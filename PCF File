Step 2: Creating the PCF File
The PCF file can be accessed here. It defines the pin assignments for the FPGA board to map the inputs and outputs defined in the Verilog code to specific physical pins on the FPGA.

Pin Assignments in the PCF File
led_red → Pin 39

led_blue → Pin 40

led_green → Pin 41

hw_clk → Pin 20

testwire → Pin 17

Cross-referencing with the VSDSquadron FPGA Mini Board Datasheet
Using the VSDSquadron FPGA Mini board datasheet, you can verify that these pin assignments match the physical pins available on the FPGA board.

Pin Mapping Explanation
led_red, led_blue, and led_green: These pins correspond to the three channels of the RGB LED on the FPGA board. Each pin is connected to one color channel of the LED.

hw_clk: This pin connects to the external clock input, which provides the hardware clock for the FPGA.

testwire: This pin can be used as a test signal output for debugging purposes, which might be useful for testing the functionality of the FPGA design.
