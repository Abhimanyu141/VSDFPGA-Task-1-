UART Loopback Documentation
1. Introduction
This documentation details the implementation of a UART loopback mechanism on the VSDSquadron FPGA Mini. The loopback mechanism is used to test UART functionality by transmitting data from the FPGA’s UART transmitter, and immediately receiving it back through the UART receiver. This helps in verifying the integrity of the UART communication system.

2. Objectives
The objective of this project is to implement a UART loopback system where transmitted data is immediately received back. This is a crucial test to ensure that the FPGA’s UART modules (both transmitter and receiver) are functioning correctly and the system can handle basic communication tasks.

3.2 Circuit Diagram
The following diagram shows the UART connections between the FPGA and the serial terminal for loopback.

TX (Transmitter) pin from FPGA is directly connected to the RX (Receiver) pin.

A PC or serial terminal connects to the FPGA via the UART interface.

4. Verilog Code Explanation
The Verilog code consists of two primary modules:

UART Transmitter: This module transmits data serially. It is responsible for converting parallel data from the FPGA into a serial stream that can be transmitted over the UART interface.

UART Receiver: This module receives the serial data transmitted over the UART interface and converts it back into parallel data, which can be used by the FPGA.

Loopback Logic
Transmitter to Receiver Loopback: The loopback mechanism is achieved by directly feeding the transmitted data from the UART transmitter back to the UART receiver. This is accomplished through the Verilog code by connecting the TX and RX signals together within the FPGA logic.

Code Snippet:

verilog
Copy
assign RX = TX; // Loopback the transmitted data to the receiver
5. Hardware Setup
FPGA Board: The VSDSquadron FPGA Mini is used in this setup.

Connection:

The TX pin of the FPGA is connected to the RX pin for the loopback functionality.

A PC or a serial terminal is connected to the FPGA through the UART interface to transmit data.

Steps for Setting Up the Hardware:
Connect the TX pin of the FPGA to the RX pin for loopback.

Connect the FPGA to the serial terminal (via USB-to-Serial or direct UART connection) for communication.

Ensure that the FPGA is powered on and the clock signals are correctly provided for UART operation.

6. Code Implementation
The Verilog code for the UART transmitter and receiver is written to handle the following:

Transmit Data: Converts the 8-bit parallel data into serial form, handling baud rate and start/stop bits.

Receive Data: Converts incoming serial data back into parallel data, ensuring correct reception and synchronization.

verilog
Copy
module uart_transmitter(
    input clk,
    input [7:0] data_in,
    output reg tx
    // other necessary pins
);
    // Transmitter logic implementation
    // Code to convert parallel data to serial
endmodule

module uart_receiver(
    input clk,
    input rx,
    output reg [7:0] data_out
    // other necessary pins
);
    // Receiver logic implementation
    // Code to convert serial data back to parallel
endmodule
The loopback is achieved by simply connecting the TX output of the transmitter to the RX input of the receiver:

verilog
Copy
assign RX = TX; // Loopback configuration
7. Testing and Verification
7.1 Testing Procedure
Serial Terminal Setup:

Open a serial terminal (e.g., PuTTY, Tera Term) on the connected PC.

Configure the terminal to communicate with the FPGA, setting the correct baud rate, data bits, stop bits, and parity settings (usually 115200 baud, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit).

Send Test Data:

Type a test message (e.g., "Hello, FPGA!") into the serial terminal and send it.

Verify Reception:

Check if the same message is displayed back in the serial terminal, confirming the loopback mechanism works as expected.

7.2 Expected Results
The data sent from the serial terminal should be received and displayed back in the terminal. This confirms that the UART transmitter and receiver are working properly in the loopback configuration.

8. Report Compilation
8.1 Components
The following components were used in this project:

FPGA: VSDSquadron FPGA Mini

UART Transmitter/Receiver: Implemented in Verilog

Serial Terminal: PuTTY or Tera Term for communication

8.2 Conclusion
The UART loopback implementation was successfully tested on the VSDSquadron FPGA Mini. Data sent from the terminal was correctly received back, confirming that both the transmitter and receiver are functioning as expected. This loopback mechanism can be expanded for more complex UART communication tests.
