Summary of Verilog Code Functionality
The Verilog code is responsible for controlling the colors of an RGB LED. It uses an internal oscillator to generate clock pulses, which drive the frequency counter and, in turn, control the RGB LED. The logic allows for different color outputs, which are mapped to the FPGA's output pins.

Pin Mapping Details from the PCF File
led_red: Pin 39

led_blue: Pin 40

led_green: Pin 41

hw_clk: Pin 20

testwire: Pin 17

These pins are mapped from the Verilog code to the physical FPGA board to control the RGB LED and other signals.

Integration Steps
Verify the Pin Mappings from the PCF file with the FPGA datasheet.

Connect the FPGA Board to the computer using USB-C and FTDI.

Use the Makefile to build and program the FPGA.

Observe the RGB LED Behavior to verify the design.

Challenges Faced and Solutions Implemented
One challenge could be verifying that the internal oscillator and frequency counter logic work correctly to drive the LED.

The solution is to check the LED's behavior and ensure it follows the expected patterns of red, blue, and green.
